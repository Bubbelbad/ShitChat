I have forked this repository from a school assignment that we made in a group for our C# course. 
It's a WPF application that mimics a social media platform and saves the information locally in json-format. 
I wanted to further develop some parts to practice it myself, and maybe develop the app a little bit further too. 

Now I'm probably not going to do more in here, since I've got some other projects going on.

## Challenges and what I've learned

My part in this group project was to develop the profile section. It was great fun to get to work with borders and some graphic design, getting the avatar and saving friends.
The hardest part was knowing when to step in and coach some of the collaborators that didn't have the courage to ask for help or was stuck in silence.
I nevertheless enjoyed working together and I'm satisfyed what we managed to create with our limited time!



## Features

- Create user account
- Edit your profile information, choose an avatar or take profile picture with integrated camera.
- Chat function where you can send messages to other users and save as json (this was not working properly, and is to be fixed)
- View to see and edit friendslist (this also needs a final touch)
